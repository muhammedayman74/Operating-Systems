        <p>An operating system is the primary software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer.<br> The operating system, also known as an “OS,” interfaces with the computer’s hardware and provides services that applications can use.</p>
        
        <p>An operating system is the core set of software on a device that keeps everything together. Operating systems communicate with the device’s hardware. They handle everything from your keyboard and mice to the Wi-Fi radio, storage devices, and display. In other words, an operating system handles input and output devices. Operating systems use device drivers written by hardware creators to communicate with their devices.</p>
        
        <p>Operating systems also include a lot of software—things like common system services, libraries, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers can use to write programs that run on the operating system.</p>
        
        <p>The operating system sits in between the applications you run and the hardware, using the hardware drivers as the interface between the two. For example, when an application wants to print something, it hands that task off to the operating system. The operating system sends the instructions to the printer, using the printer’s drivers to send the correct signals. The application that’s printing doesn’t have to care about what printer you have or understand how it works. The OS handles the details.</p>
        
        <h2>History Of OS</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Operating systems were first developed in the late 1950s to manage tape storage</li>
        <li>The General Motors Research Lab implemented the first OS in the early 1950s for their IBM 701</li>
        <li>In the mid-1960s, operating systems started to use disks</li>
        <li>In the late 1960s, the first version of the Unix OS was developed</li>
        <li>The first OS built by Microsoft was DOS. It was built in 1981 by purchasing the 86-DOS software from a Seattle company</li>
        <li>The present-day popular OS Windows first came to existence in 1985 when a GUI was created and paired with MS-DOS.</li>
